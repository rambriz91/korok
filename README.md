# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

I was provided a starter code which I then refactored to make it more efficient by removing redundant code, fixing broken links, commenting in the css and html files, and making the page more accessible than it was previously. This challenged was designed to simulate a task that a junior coder may encounter.

## Tasks 

- CSS code was consilidated and labeled
- Eliminated most class selectors in order to leverage element selectors.
- HTML was reoganized semantically and labeled by section
- Comments were added to html and css files
- alt text was added to the images and logos
- Title was added to the page
- broken links were fixed
- Refacted code and website was uploaded to the github repository
